              Our ‘Master Diver’ seemed so perfect as when we were diving far
              into the regulation globally. So often it felt like we needed a
              diving mask. Our founder, Catherine Parry also wanted to represent
              DeepView’s mission of keeping our partners safe in unchartered
              territory. Our clients are our ‘Buddies’, we continually strive to
              grow and refine skills (our tech!) with a regular dive buddy that
              you can trust and dive with frequently. Each client is assigned a
              dedicated ‘Divemaster’ who will oversee their account as we know
              how precious time is for everyone using our solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Diving culture is known for being friendly and fun, so of course
              it makes sense that the best way to dive is with the buddy system,
              where we stick together and look out for one another. We aim to
              become lifelong partners; Dive buddies are also important for
              safety reasons, will be first on the frontline to help as we enter
              a new era in cybersecurity.
